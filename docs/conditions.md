# Conditions Catalogue

This document is the authoritative reference for all `status.conditions` emitted by hermes-operator controllers. Condition types are defined as constants in `api/v1/hermesinstance_types.go` so Plans 4–6 and this document stay aligned.

## HermesInstance conditions (Plan 2)

| Type | When True | When False | Reason codes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Ready` | All subsystems reconciled and STS ready | Any subsystem failed or STS not ready | `AllSubsystemsReady`, `StatefulSetNotReady` |
| `StorageReady` | PVC exists | PVC creation failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `ConfigReady` | ConfigMap + workspace ConfigMap up to date | One of them failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `SecretsReady` | Gateway-token Secret exists (placeholder body) | Secret create failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `NetworkPolicyReady` | NP exists (or correctly absent when disabled) | Failed to (re)create / delete | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `RBACReady` | SA + Role + RoleBinding exist | Any of the three failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `ServiceReady` | Service exists | Service create / update failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `PDBReady` | PDB exists (or correctly absent) | PDB op failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `HPAReady` | HPA exists (or correctly absent) | HPA op failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `IngressReady` | Ingress exists (or correctly absent) | Ingress op failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `ServiceMonitorReady` | ServiceMonitor exists OR Prometheus-Operator CRDs absent (skipped) | ServiceMonitor op failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |
| `PrometheusRuleReady` | PrometheusRule exists OR Prometheus-Operator CRDs absent (skipped) | PrometheusRule op failed | `Reconciled`, `Error` |

### `ProfileStoreReady` (Plan 3 refinement)

`ProfileStoreReady` is set by the Honcho step in the reconcile chain. Plan 3 refines its reasons:

| Status | Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `True` | `Disabled` | `spec.profileStore.honcho.enabled` is false; the operator did not create Honcho resources. |
| `True` | `Ready` | Honcho Deployment has >=1 ready replica. |
| `False` | `DeploymentNotReady` | Honcho Deployment is missing, scaling up, or its readiness probe is failing. |

## HermesClusterDefaults conditions

| Type | When True | When False | Reason codes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Ready` | name == "cluster" | otherwise | `Singleton`, `InvalidName` |
